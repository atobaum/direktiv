# Colors

All colors we use are explicitly configured in `tailwind.config.cjs` and should be the only one that we use. Tailwind comes with some pre configred colors that we itentionally do not delete (yet?), but we should not use them and only use "our" colors.

We kept them though to make any tailwind snippet we might use (like from tailwindui.com) still copy and pasteable. But we should always adjust the colors afterwards.

From every color, tailwind will provide its color classes. So a color named `blue` can be used as `text-blue`, `bg-blue`, `border-blue` etc.

# daisy ui colors

These colors are defined in the `tailwind.config.cjs` under `daisyui.themes.THEMENAME.`

daisy ui colors are special as they are aware of its applied theme. So the color `base-100` is a bright white color in the light mode theme, and a very dark color in the darkmode theme. You can find all color names on [daisyui.com/docs/colors](https://daisyui.com/docs/colors/)

# tailwind colors

These colors are defined in the `tailwind.config.cjs` under `themes.extend.colors`. These colors are not aware of the applied theme and it must always be decided which color to use depending on the theme.

## colors, useable in dark and light mode

<ColorPalette>
  <ColorItem
    title="colorPrimary "
    subtitle="primary brand color"
    colors={{
      "primary-50": "#EEEFFF",
      "primary-100": "#CBD1FF",
      "primary-200": "#A9B2FF",
      "primary-300": "#8793FF",
      "primary-400": "#6473FF",
      "primary-500": "#5364FF",
      "primary-600": "#4554DF",
      "primary-700": "#323C99",
      "primary-800": "#212866",
      "primary-900": "#4D5469",
    }}
  />
  <ColorItem
    title="blackA"
    subtitle="Shades of black with alpha channel"
    colors={{
      ...blackA,
    }}
  />
</ColorPalette>

## colors, dependend on the theme

<ColorPalette>
  <ColorItem
    title="gray"
    subtitle="Shades of gray, only for light mode."
    colors={{
      ...gray,
    }}
  />
  <ColorItem
    title="grayDark"
    subtitle="Shades of gray, only for dark mode"
    colors={{
      ...grayDark,
    }}
  />
</ColorPalette>

Each of these palettes are bound to light or dark mode. When using them, always pick poth colors from the same column unless you have a good reason.

In this example, we apply a gray background in light and darkmode with the intensity of `12`.

```jsx
<div className="fill-gray-gray12 dark:fill-grayDark-gray12"></div>
```
