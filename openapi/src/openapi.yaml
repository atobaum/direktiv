    Welcome to the Direktiv API documentation. Our API is based on the principle of REST.

    # Introduction
    All request and response bodies are `application/json` format.
    
    # Versioning
    This is v2 api, v1 endpoints will be removed as we implement them in v2.

    # Methods
    We use the following http methods:
    | value | description |
    |-----------|-------|
    | `GET` | Get one object or a list of objects |
    | `DELETE` | Delete one object  |
    | `POST` | Create one object |
    | `PUT` | Update(replace) one object |
    Requests with methods `GET` and `DELETE` should have empty bodies.
    For other methods, request body cannot be empty.
    
    # Responses
    For successful requests processing, the API will response with http status code `200` ‚ü∂ `OK`.
    Successful response always have a json body with field `data`.
    Field `data` could be an `object`, or an `array`.
    
    # Errors
    If the API couldn't process the request for any reason, the response body will be a json object with a single field `error`.

    ### Error Body

    ```json
    {
      "error": {
          "code": "internal",
          "message": "server is currently under maintenance",
        }
    }
    ```

    Field error.code is one of the following values:

    | value | description |
    |-----------|-------|
    | `internal` | some internal server error  |
    | `request_path_not_found` | some explanation  |
    | `request_method_not_allowed` | some explanationd  |
    | `request_body_not_json` | some explanation  |
    | `resource_not_found` | path not found  |
    | `resource_already_exists` |some explanation |
    | `resource_id_invalid` | some explanation  |
    | `request_data_invalid` | some explanation |


    Http response codes for error responses could be one of the following: 
    | value | description |
    |-----------|-------|
    | `400` | invalid user input (in path, in method, in body)  |
    | `404` | resource not found  |
    | `403` | access denied for something wrong with the token |
    | `500` | Something went wrong with the server |
