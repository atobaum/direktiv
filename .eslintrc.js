     * TODO_HOOKS_TESTS
     * The Problem: All hooks tests are currently not working and have some linting issues.
     * We must decide:
     *  - Do we keep the hooks as they are?
     *    - when we migrate to typescript, we could potentially refactor them. There are a lot
     *      of repeating patterns.
     *  - if we want to keep the hooks, do we keep and update the tests
     *    - PROS: they are already written and could be useful
     *    - CONS: they are an impplementation detail and maybe
     *      should not be tested
     *    - if we delete them, we need to test the data fetching layer but on a
     *      much higher level. We might use PlayWright for end to end tests.
